#  Airline Customer Satisfaction Prediction

**Author:** Siddik Shaik  

## Overview
This project predicts airline customer satisfaction using data mining and machine learning techniques. The **SEMMA framework** is applied to analyze passenger data and identify key service factors influencing satisfaction.

## Objective
To build and evaluate predictive models that help airlines understand customer satisfaction drivers and improve service quality.

## Methodology
- SEMMA Framework: Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess  
- Data partitioning: 60% training, 20% validation, 20% testing  
- Feature transformation and preprocessing  

## Models Used
- Regression Models (DMine Regression, LARS)  
- Neural Networks (AutoNeural, DMNeural)  

## Results
- **Best Regression Model:** DMine Regression (ROC = 0.98)  
- **Best Neural Network:** AutoNeural (ROC = 0.976)  
- DMine Regression selected as the final model due to high accuracy and interpretability.

## Key Insights
- In-flight Wi-Fi and online booking ease are major satisfaction drivers  
- Majority of passengers are neutral or dissatisfied, indicating improvement opportunities
